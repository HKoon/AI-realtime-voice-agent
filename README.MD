1. **System Architecture**:
   - Main application file (app.py) that orchestrates everything
   - Separate module for text streaming (stream.py)
   - Separate module for audio generation (audio.py)

2. **Text Streaming Part (stream.py)**:
   - Uses the existing Groq streaming code we created
   - Yields complete sentences as they come in
   - Maintains real-time text display

3. **Audio Generation Part (audio.py)**:
   - Takes sentences one by one
   - Uses OpenAI's Text-to-Speech API to generate audio
   - Handles audio file management
   - Implements audio playback queue

4. **Process Flow**:
   ```
   Text Stream -> Complete Sentence -> Audio Generation -> Audio Queue -> Playback
   (continues in parallel while streaming)
   ```

5. **Key Requirements**:
   - Asynchronous processing to handle streaming and audio generation simultaneously
   - Queue system for audio playback to ensure sequential playing
   - Audio playback should wait for previous audio to finish
   - Start processing audio as soon as first sentence is complete

6. **Challenges to Address**:
   - Managing parallel processing between streaming and audio generation
   - Implementing proper audio playback queue
   - Handling potential API rate limits
   - Error handling for both streams
   - File management for generated audio files
